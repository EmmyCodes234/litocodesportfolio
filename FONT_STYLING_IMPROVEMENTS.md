# Font Styling Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to improve font styling across the entire website for better readability.

## Issues Identified

1. **Heavy Font Weights**: Body text and headings were using heavier font weights than necessary, which reduced readability
2. **Inconsistent Font Styling**: Different components were using different font weights without a consistent system
3. **Suboptimal Line Heights**: Line heights could be improved for better readability

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Global CSS Updates (`styles/globals.css`)

#### Body Text
- Reduced font weight from 300 to 200 for lighter, more readable body text
- Added slight letter spacing (0.01em) for better character separation
- Increased line height from 1.6 to 1.7 for improved readability

#### Headings
- Reduced font weight from 500 to 400 for less heavy headings
- Added slight negative letter spacing (-0.02em) for better heading cohesion

#### Display Fonts
- Reduced font weight from 500 to 400 for display fonts
- Added slight negative letter spacing (-0.01em)

#### Component Font Classes
- Defined explicit font weights for font-light (200), font-normal (300), and font-medium (400) classes

### 2. Component Updates

#### RebelsRanking Component (`components/dashboard/rebels-ranking/index.tsx`)
- Reduced font weight for rebel IDs from font-medium to font-normal

#### SecurityStatus Component (`components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx`)
- Reduced font weight for tech stack items from font-medium to font-normal

#### Type Definitions (`types/dashboard.ts`)
- Added missing `link` property to RebelRanking interface

### 3. Overall Improvements

1. **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: Headings remain appropriately prominent while body text is lighter
2. **Improved Readability**: Lighter font weights and better line heights make text easier to read
3. **Visual Consistency**: All components now follow the same font weight system
4. **Better Spacing**: Added letter spacing for improved character separation

## Files Modified

1. `styles/globals.css` - Updated global font styling
2. `components/dashboard/rebels-ranking/index.tsx` - Reduced font weight for rebel IDs
3. `components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx` - Reduced font weight for tech stack items
4. `types/dashboard.ts` - Added missing link property to RebelRanking interface

## Verification

To verify these changes:

1. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Check various sections for improved readability:
   - Body text should appear lighter and more readable
   - Headings should remain appropriately prominent
   - All text should have better line spacing
4. Verify consistency across all components

## Testing Results

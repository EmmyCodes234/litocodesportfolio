# Consistent Tech Stack Layout

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the "Our Tech Stack" section is displayed consistently on both mobile and desktop views.

## Issue

The "Our Tech Stack" section had different layouts on mobile and desktop views, which created inconsistency in the user experience.

## Solution

Modified the SecurityStatus component to use the same layout on both mobile and desktop:

1. **Unified Layout**: The animation and tech stack items now use the same arrangement on all screen sizes
2. **Consistent Animation Placement**: The animated GIF is displayed in the same position on both mobile and desktop
3. **Uniform Grid**: The tech stack items use a consistent 2-column grid on all devices

## Changes Made

### SecurityStatus Component (`components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx`)

- Removed responsive layout classes (`md:flex-row`, `md:items-start`, etc.)
- Implemented a unified flex column layout for all screen sizes
- Placed the animation section above the tech stack items consistently
- Maintained the 2-column grid for tech stack items on all devices

### Before
```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-6">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-1 gap-3 py-2 px-1 md:max-w-max">
    {/* Tech stack items */}
  </div>
  <div className="md:flex-shrink-0 md:w-1/3 flex items-center justify-center mt-4 md:mt-0">
    {/* Animation */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### After
```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col">
  {/* Animation section - same on mobile and desktop */}
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center my-4">
    {/* Animation */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Tech stack items - same layout on mobile and desktop */}
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 py-2 px-1">
    {/* Tech stack items */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**: Users see the same layout regardless of device
2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Animation is always positioned above the tech stack items
3. **Better Maintainability**: Single layout approach is easier to maintain
4. **Responsive Design**: Layout works well on all screen sizes

## Verification

To verify these changes:

1. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Scroll to the "Our Tech Stack" section
4. Check that the layout is consistent on both mobile and desktop views
5. Verify that the animation is visible and properly positioned

The changes ensure a consistent and predictable user experience across all devices while maintaining the visual appeal of the tech stack section.

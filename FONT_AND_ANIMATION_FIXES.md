# Font and Animation Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the animation overlap issue in the "My Tech Stack" section and improve font styling for better readability.

## Animation Overlap Fix

### Problem
The "My Tech Stack" section had an animation overlap issue on desktop view where the animated GIF was absolutely positioned and overlapped with the tech stack items, making them hard to read.

### Solution
Modified the [SecurityStatus](file://c:\litocodes%20portfolio\components\dashboard\security-status\index.tsx#L33-L59) component in `components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx`:

1. Changed the layout from absolute positioning to a responsive flex layout
2. Replaced the absolute positioned picture element with a responsive div containing the image
3. Used Next.js Image component with fill and object-contain for proper scaling
4. Adjusted the layout to work well on both mobile and desktop views

### Changes Made
- Changed the container from `flex-col` to `flex-col md:flex-row` for responsive layout
- Replaced absolute positioning with a flex-based layout
- Added proper spacing and sizing for the animated GIF
- Ensured the tech stack items and animation don't overlap on any screen size

## Font Styling Improvements

### Problem
The font styling was using heavy weights that reduced readability, especially for body text.

### Solution
Modified the font styling in multiple files to improve readability:

1. Updated `styles/globals.css`:
   - Changed the default sans-serif font to Roboto Mono for better readability
   - Reduced body font weight to 300 (light)
   - Set heading font weight to 500 (normal)
   - Added specific styling for display fonts

2. Updated `app/page.tsx`:
   - Reduced font weights from bold to normal for headings
   - Added font-light class to body text for better readability
   - Ensured consistent font styling across all sections

3. Updated `components/dashboard/rebels-ranking/index.tsx`:
   - Reduced font weights for project names and descriptions
   - Added font-light class to secondary text elements

4. Updated `components/dashboard/stat/index.tsx`:
   - Reduced font weights for card titles and descriptions
   - Ensured consistent styling with other components

### Changes Made
- Changed font weights from bold to normal/medium for better readability
- Added font-light classes to secondary text elements
- Switched from custom display font to Roboto Mono for better readability
- Ensured consistent font styling across all components

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Check the "My Tech Stack" section on both mobile and desktop views
4. Verify that the animated GIF no longer overlaps with the tech stack items
5. Check that all text is more readable with the adjusted font weights

## Files Modified

1. `components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx` - Fixed animation overlap
2. `styles/globals.css` - Improved base font styling
3. `app/page.tsx` - Adjusted font weights and styling
4. `components/dashboard/rebels-ranking/index.tsx` - Consistent font styling
5. `components/dashboard/stat/index.tsx` - Consistent font styling

These changes ensure a better user experience with improved readability and proper layout on all screen sizes.

# Animation and Font Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the animation visibility issue in the "Our Tech Stack" section and improve font styling for better readability.

## Issues Identified

1. **Animation Not Visible on Desktop**: The animated GIF in the "Our Tech Stack" section was not properly visible on desktop view due to sizing issues with the Next.js Image component.

2. **Font Styling**: The font styling improvements needed refinement for better readability.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Animation Visibility Fix

**Problem**: The animated GIF was not visible on desktop view due to improper sizing and positioning.

**Solution**: Modified the SecurityStatus component in `components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx`:

- Added `priority` prop to the Image component to ensure proper loading
- Adjusted the height of the container for better visibility on desktop
- Maintained responsive design for mobile view

**Changes**:
```typescript
<div className="relative w-full h-48 md:h-64">
  <Image
    src="/assets/bot_greenprint.gif"
    alt="Tech Stack"
    fill
    quality={90}
    className="object-contain"
    priority // Added this to ensure proper loading
  />
</div>
```

### 2. Font Styling Improvements

**Problem**: Font styling needed refinement for better readability.

**Solution**: Made several adjustments to font styling in multiple files:

1. **Global CSS (`styles/globals.css`)**:
   - Ensured Roboto Mono is used as the default font family
   - Added line-height improvements for better readability
   - Adjusted font weights for better visual hierarchy

2. **Page Content (`app/page.tsx`)**:
   - Changed heading font weights from `font-normal` to `font-medium` for better emphasis
   - Maintained consistent font styling across all sections

3. **Type Definitions (`types/dashboard.ts`)**:
   - Fixed the SecurityStatus interface to match the actual mock data structure
   - Removed unnecessary properties that weren't present in the mock data

## Files Modified

1. `components/dashboard/security-status/index.tsx` - Fixed animation visibility
2. `styles/globals.css` - Improved font styling and readability
3. `app/page.tsx` - Adjusted heading font weights
4. `types/dashboard.ts` - Fixed type definitions to match mock data

## Verification

To verify these changes:

1. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Scroll to the "Our Tech Stack" section
4. Verify that the animated GIF is visible on both mobile and desktop views
5. Check that all text is more readable with the adjusted font weights

## Testing Results

The changes have been tested and verified to:

- ✅ Make the animation visible on desktop view
- ✅ Improve overall font readability
- ✅ Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Fix type errors in the codebase

These changes ensure a better user experience with improved visibility of the tech stack animation and better readability of all text content.
